<ol><li class="normal">This Privacy Policy is Infomedia Ltd's official privacy policy and it applies to all personal information collected by Infomedia Ltd. In this policy, we explain how and why we collect your personal information, how we use it and what controls you have over our use of it.</li>
<li class="normal">Infomedia Ltd is committed to complying with Australian Commonwealth legislation (located at: <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/" target="_blank">http://www.privacy.gov.au</a> ) governing privacy of personal information by businesses and to protecting and safeguarding your privacy when you deal with us.</li>
<div class="steptext" style="padding-top:15px;padding-bottom:5px;"><strong>Collection of Information</strong></div>
<li class="normal">Some information provided to us by clients, customers and contractors and other third parties might be considered private or personal. Without these details we would not be able to carry on our business and provide our services to you. We will only collect such personal information if it is necessary for one or more of our functions or services.</li>
<li class="normal">In particular, personal information is collected from people in the following situations by Infomedia Ltd:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc"><li class="normal">If you contact Infomedia Ltd, we may keep a record of that correspondence;</li>
<li class="normal">When you submit your email address to our website mailing list;</li>
<li class="normal">When you purchase a product over our website.</li>
</ul><li class="normal">At or before the time the personal information is collected by us we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of who we are, the fact that you are able to gain access to the information held about you, the purpose of the collection, the type(s) of organisations to which we usually disclose the information collected about you, any laws requiring the collection of the information and the main consequence for you if all or part of the information is not collected.</li>
<li class="normal">Infomedia Ltd will never request your credit card information by email.</li>
<div class="steptext" style="padding-top:15px;padding-bottom:5px;"><strong>Use of Information Collected and Disclosure of Personal Information to Others</strong></div>
<li class="normal">We may use or disclose personal information held about an individual for the primary purpose for which it is collected (e.g. provision of our services, including administration of our services, fulfilment of orders placed by you on our servers, notification to you about changes to our services, record-keeping following termination of our services to you and technical maintenance). We may also use such information for a purpose related to the primary purpose of collection and where it would reasonably be expected by you that we would use the information in such a way. This information is only disclosed to persons outside our business in the circumstances set out in this policy or as otherwise notified to you at the time of collection of the information.</li>
<li class="normal">In addition, we are permitted to use or disclose personal information held about you:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc"><li class="normal">Where you have consented to the use or disclosure;</li>
<li class="normal">Where we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious, immediate threat to someone's health or safety or the public's health or safety;</li>
<li class="normal">Where we reasonably suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in and the use or disclosure is a necessary part of our investigation or in reporting the matter to the relevant authorities;</li>
<li class="normal">Where such use or disclosure is required under or authorised by law (for example, to comply with a subpoena, a warrant or other order of a court or legal process);</li>
<li class="normal">Where we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for prevention, investigation, prosecution and punishment of crimes or wrongdoings or the preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal or the implementation of the orders of a court or tribunal by or on behalf of an enforcement body.</li>
</ul><div class="steptext" style="padding-top:15px;padding-bottom:5px;"><strong>Links</strong></div>
